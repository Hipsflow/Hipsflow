## Projects
Here are a few projects I've worked on that showcase my skills:
- [MVC Php framework](https://github.com/Hipsflow/MVC-Framework-): A project i've created out of the need to make a simple Php webapp, but being restrained by large frameworks, or Crude operations with no standart or documentation. So i've used the concepts of MVC to create a Php 7.4 and MySQL DB, abble to be used as an API or Full Stack application.
